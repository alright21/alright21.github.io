&lt;p>This is a list of coding projects I helped to translate in Italian for the &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi Foundation&lt;/a>. Those projects are useful for &lt;a href="https://coderdojo.com/en">Coderdojo&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://codeclub.org/en/">Codeclub&lt;/a> during their meetings. In Milano, we started using them, and they are great! I suggest taking a look at those if you are into Computer Science education in primary schools in Italy (or in other countries, there are several languages available). These are the main projects, but there are other interesting tutorials you can find there (and some of them are already translated).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coderdojo Turtle Race</title><link>https://blog.alright21.me/education/coderdojo_turtle_race/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 19:04:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.alright21.me/education/coderdojo_turtle_race/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello everyone! Today I will show you what I am planning to do in future Coderdojo sessions with young ninjas who would like to learn Python.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Raspberry Pi &lt;a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects">projects&lt;/a> page, there are some interesting learning paths and tutorials that we can use to teach Scratch, Python, Pi Pico and more. I found out this interesting project with Python called &lt;a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/turtle-race">Turtle Race&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a fun project because kids learn about some advanced &lt;code>turtle&lt;/code> and Python features, while creating a simple game.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
