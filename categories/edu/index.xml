Those projects are useful for Coderdojo and Codeclub during their meetings. In Milano, we started using them, and they are great! I suggest taking a look at those if you are into Computer Science education in primary schools in Italy (or in other countries, there are several languages available).</description></item><item><title>Coderdojo Turtle Race</title><link>https://alright21.github.io/education/coderdojo_turtle_race/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 19:04:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://alright21.github.io/education/coderdojo_turtle_race/</guid><description>Coderdojo Turtle Race Hello everyone! Today I will show you what I am planning to do in future Coderdojo sessions with young ninjas who would like to learn Python.
In the Raspberry Pi projects page, there are some interesting learning paths and tutorials that we can use to teach Scratch, Python, Pi Pico and more. I found out this interesting project with Python called Turtle Race.
It is a fun project because kids learn about some advanced turtle and Python features, while creating a simple game.</description></item></channel></rss>
