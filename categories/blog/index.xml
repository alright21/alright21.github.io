I tried to check if I could do it by setting up Wireshark on my laptop and detect this communication directly from that, but it was not working.
I thought I could change my perspective and monitor traffic directly from my device (it is always Linux).</description></item><item><title>Intercepting Traffic in Mobile Flutter Applications</title><link>https://alright21.github.io/blog/mobile_flutter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 08:50:38 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://alright21.github.io/blog/mobile_flutter/</guid><description>Intercepting Traffic in Mobile Flutter Applications During our tests, it may happen that we have to find vulnerabilities in applications built with the Flutter framework. It is pretty common when we have both Android and iOS apps. This framework raises some problems when we need to intercept traffic for two reasons:
flutter apps are proxy unaware - if we add a proxy listener from the settings of our phone, the application will ignore it flutter apps often implement ssl pinning techniques that are not easily bypassed using standard frida scripts Below are explained the solutions for Android and iOS.</description></item><item><title>Mobile Security Introduction</title><link>https://alright21.github.io/blog/mobile_security_intro/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 18:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://alright21.github.io/blog/mobile_security_intro/</guid><description>Mobile Security Introduction After quite a while, I finally decided to upload this article.

Have fun reading! :)
