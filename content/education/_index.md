In this section I will write about education in Computer Science, and I will mainly focus on [Coderdojo](https://coderdojo.com/en) activities in Milan. I am volunteering at the local dojo, and I will help young ninjas to discover the magical world of programming and computational thinking. I am doing projects with Scratch (see my profile [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/alright21/)), and Python.
