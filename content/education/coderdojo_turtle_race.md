Hello everyone! Today I will show you what I am planning to do in future Coderdojo sessions with young ninjas who would like to learn Python.

In the Raspberry Pi [projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects) page, there are some interesting learning paths and tutorials that we can use to teach Scratch, Python, Pi Pico and more. I found out this interesting project with Python called [Turtle Race](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/turtle-race).

It is a fun project because kids learn about some advanced `turtle` and Python features, while creating a simple game.

The goal of the project is to draw a track where some turtles will run on.

I decided to clean up the code a bit, by creating a function to initialize the players, and the code to draw the final ranking. It is a bit trickier to teach, but I thought it was fun to see which turtle is the winner :)

Here is a screenshot of the final painting:
